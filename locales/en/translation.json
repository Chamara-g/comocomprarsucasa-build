    "head": "How Fannie Mae’s New Credit Score Rule Can Help You",
    "txt_1": "Becoming a homeowner is a huge accomplishment and a major milestone for many Americans. Though the home-ownership rate has increased in the past year, there are many individuals impacted by the pandemic who are struggling to reach this goal. ",
    "txt_2": "If you are at least a bit familiar with the home buying process, you know that there are many factors that are evaluated when applying for a mortgage loan. Five major factors that determine approval are your credit score, debt-to-income ratio, down payment, work history, and the value and condition of the home. In the past year alone, many Americans lost their jobs during the pandemic, which in some cases affected their credit scores and concurrently their chances of becoming a homeowner. This has especially been the case for couples in which one partner is a very strong candidate for a mortgage loan and the other may be an average candidate who has faced challenges in their credit journey. ",
    "txt_3": "Fannie Mae’s new credit score rule makes buying or refinancing a home easier for co-borrowers from dual-income households. Here is a breakdown of what this new change entails and how it can help couples acquire a mortgage loan. ",
    "txt_4": "How Has Mortgage Loan Approval Worked In The Past?",
    "txt_5": "As we previously mentioned, a high credit score is a major factor in determining mortgage loan eligibility. Your credit score is determined based on your past payment history and borrowing behavior. When applying for a mortgage, a credit score has a huge impact on an approval. Conventional loans typically require a FICO score of at least 620. The higher your score, the more likely you will be approved and the better your interest rate will be. ",
    "txt_6": "Dual-income households have a better chance of getting approved for a mortgage loan if both the primary and secondary borrowers are strong applicants. This is challenging for partners who have completely different credit profiles which is very common.",
    "txt_7": "In the past, Fannie Mae required both co-borrowers to have a minimum credit score of 620 in order to move forward with a mortgage loan. For example, if two co-borrowers had scores of 690 and 580, they were not eligible to buy or refinance a home together since one of them did not meet the minimum credit score requirement of 620. In this case, the borrower with the higher credit score would more than likely have to apply as a single applicant which can pose challenges if they have a higher debt-to-income ratio or do not have a strong work history to back them up. Single borrowers must qualify for the mortgage loan based on their single income, which could negatively affect the outcome of approval.",
    "txt_8": "How Does The New Credit Rule Work and How Does it Benefit You?",
    "txt_9": "As of September 18, 2021, Fannie Mae’s new credit score rule allows lenders to average the co-borrower’s FICO scores together to determine eligibility for a conventional loan.",
    "txt_10": "What does this mean for you? Using the same example of the two co-borrowers with credit scores of 690 and 580, if we were to evaluate their average credit score it would be 635. Where they may have struggled before, this new average score makes the co-borrowers eligible to buy or refinance a home.",
    "txt_11": "Combined income may allow two co-borrowers to qualify for a larger loan amount since together they can afford a higher monthly mortgage payment. With Fannie Mae’s new rule, co-borrowers have a better chance of final approval for a home loan based on their average combined credit score and both their incomes taken into consideration.",
    "txt_12": "Fannie Mae’s new credit rule can also help couples save money by refinancing their mortgage loan for a chance to receive lower interest rates on their current loan. Previous borrowers who were forced to apply as individual applicants can now refinance as dual-income households to lower their monthly mortgage payments and decrease interest fees.",

    "txt_15": "Conventional loans follow lending rules set by Fannie Mae, offering mortgages with as little as 3% down. This new credit rule change has arrived just in time as mortgage rates are beginning to rise."

    "txt_4": "FHA loans and conventional loans have vastly different credit score thresholds. In addition, with the FHA loan, your credit score also affects the minimum down payment requirement.",
    "txt_5": "With the FHA loan, homebuyers whose credit score is 580 or higher may qualify for the lower 3.5 percent down payment option, while those with a credit score between 500 and 579 may still qualify, but need at least 10 percent down.",
    "txt_6": "Conventional credit requirements can vary by lender, but typically conventional loans require a credit score in the 620-640 range regardless of down payment. This higher threshold often excludes those with less-than-perfect credit and many first-time homebuyers.",

    "txt_9": "Down payment requirements for conventional loans can vary by lender and other factors but a 5 percent minimum is common. That would mean a $10,000 down payment on a $200,000 property.",
    "txt_10": "If coming up with your down payment is difficult, both loan types allow you to use gift money toward your payment. However, with an FHA loan, your entire down payment can be from gift funds, while those using a conventional loan may need to put down a portion of their own funds before being able to include gift money. Talk with a lender for more details.",
    "txt_11": "Conventional and FHA Mortgage Insurance Costs",
    "txt_12": "Conventional loans typically require private mortgage insurance unless borrowers can put down 20 percent. Costs for PMI can vary based on your credit score and other factors, but it can easily add $100 or more to your monthly payment. This expense typically ends once your loan-to-value ratio reaches 80 percent.",
    "txt_13": "Conversely, FHA loans require mortgage insurance no matter what -- even if you’re putting 20 percent down. FHA loans come with both a one-time upfront fee and annual mortgage insurance premium (which you’ll pay monthly, as part of your mortgage payment).",
    "txt_14": "FHA Upfront MIP",
    "txt_15": "The upfront MIP, sometimes referred to as the FHA funding fee, is 1.75 percent of the loan amount. This fee is due at closing and is typically financed into the entire loan amount to reduce out of pocket costs.",

    "txt_13": "The FHA Streamline refinance is meant to be a quick, painless process for existing FHA borrowers. The assumption is that because the homeowner has already passed the FHA’s stringent requirements once, they do not need to be as carefully vetted the second time around.

    "txt_3": "FHA loans are ideal for homebuyers without sufficient savings for a large down payment or those with less-than-perfect credit, lacking the ability to qualify for a conventional loan. FHA loans require a minimum credit score of at least 580 to take advantage of the program’s 3.5 percent down payment option. Those with scores below 580 may still qualify for FHA funding, but will need to put at least 10 percent down.",
    "txt_4": "Are FHA loans assumable?",
    "txt_5": "An assumable mortgage allows homebuyers to take over a seller’s mortgage, including the rate, repayment period, current principal balance and other loan terms. Currently only government backed loan options allow assumable mortgages - conventional loans are typically not assumable.",
    "txt_6": "The primary advantage to assuming a mortgage is securing a lower interest rate rather than applying for a new loan when rates are higher. Often assuming an existing mortgage is less costly for the buyer than obtaining a new loan.",
